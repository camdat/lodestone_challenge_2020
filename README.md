# Lodestone Coding Challenge 2020 - Nathan Tokala

This project was completed per the design description of the Lodestone Coding Challenge.

# Getting Started

For the purposes of reviewing the work done for the challenge, start with "main.py", it's designed to be read  by humans with markers for visualizing any datapoints generated by the file, as well as specific areas where each step of the challenge occurs. There are two other assistive files in this project: randGen.py, which generates random rows of data from given input labels, and helperFuncs.py, which assists with checking agreement and reading or writing to a csv file. 

Finally, example versions of each visualization can be found in the examples/ folder.

## randGen.py

```
class Generator(builtins.object)
 |  Generator(seed=None, date_tup=None, **labels)
 |  
 |  Generator generates random rows of data based on 
 |  ranges defined at either initialization or call time
 |  this allows it to be very flexible and able to generate
 |  rows of many types
 |  
 |  Attributes
 |  ----------
 |  date_tup: optional
 |      defines the date range to be generated within.
 |  
 |  **labels: optional
 |      optional additonal labels to randomize between.
 |      
 |      in the case of Lodestone's requirements, these are key/value
 |      pairs which define rater score, correct/rater answers, etc. 
 |      an example usage based on those requirements is given below
 |  
 |  Methods
 |  -------
 |  __gen_date: private
 |      generates a random datetime.datetime object from given datetime range
 |  
 |  __gen_lab: private
 |      picks a random element from an input list
 |  
 |  __gen_num: private
 |      generates a randome number from given range
 |  
 |  gen_row: public
 |      generates a row from either initalized or given variables
 |  
 |  gen_n_rows: public
 |      generates n rows of the given pattern, with id fields
 |  
 |  Examples
 |  --------
 |  
 |  Define ranges at calltime:
 |      g = Generator()
 |      g.gen_row((datetime.datetime(2005, 10, 1), datetime.datetime(2005, 11, 2), a=['A', 'B', 'C']
 |  
 |      returns: {'date': datetime.datetime(2005, 10, 2, 21, 56, 16), 'a':'B'}
 |  
 |  Define ranges at initialization:
 |      date_range = (datetime.datetime(2005, 10, 1), datetime.datetime(2005, 10, 30))
 |      rater_score = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
 |      answer_3 = ['Low', 'Average', 'High']
 |      answer_5 = ['Bad', 'Okay', 'Intermediate', 'Great', 'Exceptional']
 |  
 |  
 |      g = Generator(seed=None, date_tup=date_range, cor_3=answer_3, cor_5=answer_5, rater_3=answer_3, rater_5=answer_5)
 |      g.gen_row()
 |  
 |      returns: {'date': datetime.datetime(2005, 10, 2, 21, 56, 16), 'cor_3': 'High', 'cor_5': 'Great', 'rater_3': 'Average', 'rater_5': 'Exceptional'}

```

## helperFuncs.py
```
Functions
--------------
check_agreement(rows)
	checks agreement between rater and engineer for each row of a given input array, rows.

write_csv(filename, header, rows):
	writes a csv file to filename, with header header, and filled with the values of each row

read_csv(filename):
	for a given csv file, filename, return an output array containing the elements of the input based on the header file
